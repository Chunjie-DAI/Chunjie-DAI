>Our objective is to improve the efficiency while running the motor. In this report, it is mainly the permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). In other words, we want to reduce the power loss. To answer this question, we need to figure out how these losses generated during working process and how to classify them.

Based on this paper (Combined Experimental and Numerical Method for Loss Separation in Permanent-Magnet Brushless Machines)[1], together with my understanding, classification of power loss is completed below. According to the source and characteristics, there are different methods to classify.
-	Iron loss
-	Copper loss or Conduction loss
-	Friction and Windage
-	Other losses

**Iron loss**: In principle, they are caused by a changing magnetic field. They can be classify in to 3 types
-	Hysteresis loss: Energy lost in B-H loop curve with varying operating point, movement of domain wall.
-	Eddy-current loss: Eddy current generated by electromagnetic induction will occur heat in iron core.
-	Anomalous loss: Hysteresis loop is also changing with frequency. And there are small mount of eddy current are caused by movement of domain wall.Losses in this category is usually neglected in many situations.

As aforementioned, iron loss is caused by a changing magnetic field. There are actually 2 reasons that cause a changing magnetic field. Source 1 is the rotation of rotor with PM inside. Source 2 is AC in the armature winding which creates a changing magnetic field.

**Copper loss or Conduction loss**: They caused by the heat produced by current in the winding. They can be classified into 2 types:
-	DC conduction loss: They are I2R, the largest part of copper loss.
-	AC conduction loss: They are skin effect and proximity effect.

**Friction and Windage**: They are mechanical losses. According to the location, they can be classified into 2 types:
-	Bearing loss
-	Windage loss

**Other losses**: They are caused by PWM carrier frequency.
